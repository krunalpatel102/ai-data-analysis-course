    "\n",
    "1. **Contextualize:** Identify your context. What data are you working with? What's the general topic of what you're trying to do? This initial context is crucial for framing your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set a Goal:** What is your general goal? What do you want to achieve with this data analysis? Having a clear objective is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Strategize:** With that goal in mind, what's a good strategy for getting there? What tools do you want to use? What approaches or methods? What order do you need to do things in? Planning your approach ensures better outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Implement:** A carefully articulated strategy should help you in this main process that implements your tools and methods. Many people skip to this step without doing the work beforehand!\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interact:** This is the iterative process of data analysis. You will need to interpret your results, troubleshoot if things aren't going your way, or iterate to get a more refined version of what you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Document:** Once you've got what you want, make sure you record—in detail—what you did to get there! This is important both for sharing data and for revisiting your analyses later yourself."
